\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec:intro}
% project
The Clever Algorithms project aims to describe a large number of algorithms from the fields of Computational Intelligence, Biologically Inspired Computation, and Metaheuristics in a complete, consistent and centralized manner \cite{Brownlee2010}.
% description
The project requires all algorithms to be described using a standardized template that includes a fixed number of sections, each of which is motivated by the presentation of specific information about the technique \cite{Brownlee2010a}.
% this report
This report describes the Evolutionary Programming algorithm using the standardized template.

% Name
% The algorithm name defines the canonical name used to refer to the technique, in addition to common aliases, abbreviations, and acronyms. The name is used in terms of the heading and sub-headings of an algorithm description.
\section{Name} 
\label{sec:name}
% What is the canonical name and common aliases for a technique?
% What are the common abbreviations and acronyms for a technique?
% The heading and alternate headings for the algorithm description.
Evolutionary Programming, EP

% Taxonomy: Lineage and locality
% The algorithm taxonomy defines where a techniques fits into the field, both the specific subfields of Computational Intelligence and Biologically Inspired Computation as well as the broader field of Artificial Intelligence. The taxonomy also provides a context for determining the relation- ships between algorithms. The taxonomy may be described in terms of a series of relationship statements or pictorially as a venn diagram or a graph with hierarchical structure.
\section{Taxonomy}
\label{sec:taxonomy}
% To what fields of study does a technique belong?
an instance of an EA, belongs to EC, broadly belongs to CI and BIC. it is a stochastic optimization technique.
% What are the closely related approaches to a technique?
Siblings with GA, GP, ES, and LCS
lots of extensions

sometimes confused with genetic programming
these days hard to differentiate from ES, although were developed independently

% Inspiration: Motivating system
% The inspiration describes the specific system or process that provoked the inception of the algorithm. The inspiring system may non-exclusively be natural, biological, physical, or social. The description of the inspiring system may include relevant domain specific theory, observation, nomenclature, and most important must include those salient attributes of the system that are somehow abstractly or conceptually manifest in the technique. The inspiration is described textually with citations and may include diagrams to highlight features and relationships within the inspiring system.
% Optional
\section{Inspiration}
\label{sec:inspiration}
% What is the system or process that motivated the development of a technique?
% Which features of the motivating system are relevant to a technique?

evolution, not genetic evolution but species level 


% Metaphor: Explanation via analogy
% The metaphor is a description of the technique in the context of the inspiring system or a different suitable system. The features of the technique are made apparent through an analogous description of the features of the inspiring system. The explanation through analogy is not expected to be literal scientific truth, rather the method is used as an allegorical communication tool. The inspiring system is not explicitly described, this is the role of the ‘inspiration’ element, which represents a loose dependency for this element. The explanation is textual and uses the nomenclature of the metaphorical system.
% Optional
\section{Metaphor}
\label{sec:metaphor}
% What is the explanation of a technique in the context of the inspiring system?
% What are the functionalities inferred for a technique from the analogous inspiring system?


% Strategy: Problem solving plan
% The strategy is an abstract description of the computational model. The strategy describes the information processing actions a technique shall take in order to achieve an objective. The strategy provides a logical separation between a computational realization (procedure) and a analogous system (metaphor). A given problem solving strategy may be realized as one of a number specific algorithms or problem solving systems. The strategy description is textual using information processing and algorithmic terminology.
\section{Strategy}
\label{sec:strategy}
% What is the information processing objective of a technique?
% What is a techniques plan of action?

top down evolution compared to the bottom up
no attempt at sub-symbolic credit assignment

% Procedure: Abstract computation
% The algorithmic procedure summarizes the specifics of realizing a strategy as a systemized and parameterized computation. It outlines how the algorithm is organized in terms of the data structures and representations. The procedure may be described in terms of software engineering and computer science artifacts such as pseudo code, design diagrams, and relevant mathematical equations.
\section{Procedure}
\label{sec:procedure}
% What is the computational recipe for a technique?
% What are the data structures and representations used in a technique?
Algorithm~\ref{alg:evolutionary_programming} provides a pseudo-code listing of the Evolutionary Programming algorithm for minimizing a cost function.

% Heuristics: Usage guidelines
% The heuristics element describe the commonsense, best practice, and demonstrated rules for applying and configuring a parameterized algorithm. The heuristics relate to the technical details of the techniques procedure and data structures for general classes of application (neither specific implementations not specific problem instances). The heuristics are described textually, such as a series of guidelines in a bullet-point structure.
\section{Heuristics}
\label{sec:heuristics}
% What are the suggested configurations for a technique?
% What are the guidelines for the application of a technique to a problem instance?
\begin{itemize}
	\item bout size is commonly 5\% to 10\% of the population
	\item representation was originally FSM, now anything - domain specific representations. continuous func opt is population now
	\item traditionally only uses mutation and no crossover, although crossover can be used
	\item focus on linkage of parent of offspring, less concerned with genetic operators.
	\item EP is an abstraction of evolution at the species level, different from the others that focus at the population of individuals level (whatever...) macro-evolution rather than micro-evolution
	\item Gaussian mutation when used for non-linear programming
	\item can adapt the parameters for mutation along with the data being evolved \cite{Fogel1991a}
	
\end{itemize}

% The code description provides a minimal but functional version of the technique implemented with a programming language. The code description must be able to be typed into an appropriate computer, compiled or interpreted as need be, and provide a working execution of the technique. The technique implementation also includes a minimal problem instance to which it is applied, and both the problem and algorithm implementations are complete enough to demonstrate the techniques procedure. The description is presented as a programming source code listing.
\section{Code Listing}
\label{sec:code}
% How is a technique implemented as an executable program?
% How is a technique applied to a concrete problem instance?
Listing~\ref{evolutionary_programming} provides an example of the Evolutionary Programming algorithm implemented in the Ruby Programming Language.
% problem
The demonstration problem is an instance of a continuous function optimization that seeks $min f(x)$ where $f=\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i}^2$, $-5.0\leq x_i \leq 5.0$ and $n=2$. The optimal solution for this basin function is $(v_0,\ldots,v_{n-1})=0.0$.
% algorithm
The algorithm is an implementation of Evolutionary Programming based on Fogel et al's classical implementation for continuous function optimization \cite{Fogel1991a}.

% References: Deeper understanding
% The references element description includes a listing of both primary sources of information about the technique as well as useful introductory sources for novices to gain a deeper understanding of the theory and application of the technique.
