Clever Algorithms: Nature-Inspired Programming Recipes 

Implementing an Artificial Intelligence algorithm is difficult as algorithm descriptions may be incomplete, inconsistent, and distributed across a number of papers, chapters and even websites. This can result in varied interpretations of algorithms, limited exposure and undue attrition of algorithms, and ultimately bad science.

In an effort to address this concern, a large number of algorithmic techniques from the fields of Metaheuristics, Biologically Inspired Computation and Computational Intelligence have been described in a complete, consistent, and centralized manner. This book is the outcome of this effort providing a handbook of algorithm recipes. These standardized descriptions were carefully designed to be accessible, usable, and understandable. Most of the algorithms described were originally inspired by biological and natural systems, such as the adaptive capabilities of genetic evolution and the acquired immune system, and the foraging behaviors of birds, bees, ants and bacteria. An encyclopedic algorithm reference, this book is intended for research scientists, engineers, students, and interested amateurs.

Each algorithm description provides a working code example in the Ruby Programming Language. Source code and additional resources can be downloaded from the books companion website online at http://www.CleverAlgorithms.com
