\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec:intro}
% project
The Clever Algorithms project aims to describe a large number of algorithms from the fields of Computational Intelligence, Biologically Inspired Computation, and Metaheuristics in a complete, consistent and centralized manner \cite{Brownlee2010}.
% description
The project requires all algorithms to be described using a standardized template that includes a fixed number of sections, each of which is motivated by the presentation of specific information about the technique \cite{Brownlee2010a}.

% Name
% The algorithm name defines the canonical name used to refer to the technique, in addition to common aliases, abbreviations, and acronyms. The name is used in terms of the heading and sub-headings of an algorithm description.
\section{Name} 
\label{sec:name}
% What is the canonical name and common aliases for a technique?
% What are the common abbreviations and acronyms for a technique?
% The heading and alternate headings for the algorithm description.

% Taxonomy: Lineage and locality
% The algorithm taxonomy defines where a techniques fits into the field, both the specific subfields of Computational Intelligence and Biologically Inspired Computation as well as the broader field of Artificial Intelligence. The taxonomy also provides a context for determining the relation- ships between algorithms. The taxonomy may be described in terms of a series of relationship statements or pictorially as a venn diagram or a graph with hierarchical structure.
\section{Taxonomy}
\label{sec:taxonomy}
% To what fields of study does a technique belong?
evolutionary computation, an instance of an evolutionary algorithm
% What are the closely related approaches to a technique?
sister techniques include ga, es, ep and lcs

descendant techniques include multiple population gp, lots of others


% Inspiration: Motivating system
% The inspiration describes the specific system or process that provoked the inception of the algorithm. The inspiring system may non-exclusively be natural, biological, physical, or social. The description of the inspiring system may include relevant domain specific theory, observation, nomenclature, and most important must include those salient attributes of the system that are somehow abstractly or conceptually manifest in the technique. The inspiration is described textually with citations and may include diagrams to highlight features and relationships within the inspiring system.
% Optional
\section{Inspiration}
\label{sec:inspiration}
% What is the system or process that motivated the development of a technique?
% Which features of the motivating system are relevant to a technique?

population biology


% Metaphor: Explanation via analogy
% The metaphor is a description of the technique in the context of the inspiring system or a different suitable system. The features of the technique are made apparent through an analogous description of the features of the inspiring system. The explanation through analogy is not expected to be literal scientific truth, rather the method is used as an allegorical communication tool. The inspiring system is not explicitly described, this is the role of the ‘inspiration’ element, which represents a loose dependency for this element. The explanation is textual and uses the nomenclature of the metaphorical system.
% Optional
\section{Metaphor}
\label{sec:metaphor}
% What is the explanation of a technique in the context of the inspiring system?
% What are the functionalities inferred for a technique from the analogous inspiring system?

pop

% Strategy: Problem solving plan
% The strategy is an abstract description of the computational model. The strategy describes the information processing actions a technique shall take in order to achieve an objective. The strategy provides a logical separation between a computational realization (procedure) and a analogous system (metaphor). A given problem solving strategy may be realized as one of a number specific algorithms or problem solving systems. The strategy description is textual using information processing and algorithmic terminology.
\section{Strategy}
\label{sec:strategy}
% What is the information processing objective of a technique?
improve the adaptive fit between a population of candidate programs and an objective function
% What is a techniques plan of action?
evolutionary operations to tree structures that represent a call graph of an executable program

all about the induction of a computer program

cost is determined by executing the program


% Procedure: Abstract computation
% The algorithmic procedure summarizes the specifics of realizing a strategy as a systemized and parameterized computation. It outlines how the algorithm is organized in terms of the data structures and representations. The procedure may be described in terms of software engineering and computer science artifacts such as pseudo code, design diagrams, and relevant mathematical equations.
\section{Procedure}
\label{sec:procedure}
% What is the computational recipe for a technique?
% What are the data structures and representations used in a technique?
Algorithm~\ref{alg:genetic_programming} provides a pseudo-code listing of the Genetic Programming algorithm for minimizing a cost function.

% Heuristics: Usage guidelines
% The heuristics element describe the commonsense, best practice, and demonstrated rules for applying and configuring a parameterized algorithm. The heuristics relate to the technical details of the techniques procedure and data structures for general classes of application (neither specific implementations not specific problem instances). The heuristics are described textually, such as a series of guidelines in a bullet-point structure.
\section{Heuristics}
\label{sec:heuristics}
% What are the suggested configurations for a technique?
% What are the guidelines for the application of a technique to a problem instance?
\begin{itemize}
	\item The evaluation (fitness assignment) of a candidate solution typically take the structure of the program into account, rewarding parsimony.
	\item The selection process should be balanced between random selection and greedy selection to bias the search towards fitter candidate solutions (exploitation), whilst promoting useful diversity into the population (exploration).
	
	
	\item an adaptive system for improving the performance of a population of candidates and an objective function
	\item problems are phrased as optimization problems that are solved by a program
	\item used for machine learning tasks such as function approximation
	\item can take input or just generate a result
	\item functions that return a value should always return a value, for example division by zero should return something useful
	
	\item can represent and execute the program as a stack (related to linear representation) \cite{Perkis1994}
	\item can use ADFs to evolve functions at the same time as the program is evolving to use the functions
	\item the operators may be considered transformation programs and evolved with the system - meta level or co-evolved \cite{Angeline1996}
	
	\item during crossover - 0.9 of selecting a function, 0.1 of selecting a terminal as the swap point
	
\end{itemize}

% The code description provides a minimal but functional version of the technique implemented with a programming language. The code description must be able to be typed into an appropriate computer, compiled or interpreted as need be, and provide a working execution of the technique. The technique implementation also includes a minimal problem instance to which it is applied, and both the problem and algorithm implementations are complete enough to demonstrate the techniques procedure. The description is presented as a programming source code listing.
\section{Code Listing}
\label{sec:code}
% How is a technique implemented as an executable program?
% How is a technique applied to a concrete problem instance?
Listing~\ref{genetic_programming} provides an example of the Genetic Programming algorithm implemented in the Ruby Programming Language based on Koza and Poli's tutorial \cite{Koza2003a}.
 
% problem
The demonstration problem is an instance of a symbolic regression, where a function must be devised to match a set of observations. In this case the target function is $x^2+x+1$ where $x \in [-1,1]$. The observations are generated directly from the target function without noise for the purposes of this example. In practical problems, if one knew and had access to the target function then the genetic program would not be required.

% algorithm
The algorithm must devise a program with the function set $\{ +, -, \times, \div \}$ and the terminal set $\{ X, R \}$, where $X$ is the input value, and $R$ is a static random variable generated for a program $X \in [-5,5]$. A division by zero returns a value of one. 
% fitness
The fitness of a candidate solution is calculated by evaluating the program on range of random input values and calculating the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
% config
The algorithm is configured with a 90\% probability of crossover, 9\% probability of reproduction (copying), and a 2\% probability of mutation.
% missing
For brevity, the algorithm does not implement the architecture altering genetic operation and does not bias crossover points towards functions over terminals.
