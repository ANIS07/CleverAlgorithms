\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec:intro}
% project
The Clever Algorithms project aims to describe a large number of algorithms from the fields of Computational Intelligence, Biologically Inspired Computation, and Metaheuristics in a complete, consistent and centralized manner \cite{Brownlee2010}.
% description
The project requires all algorithms to be described using a standardized template that includes a fixed number of sections, each of which is motivated by the presentation of specific information about the technique \cite{Brownlee2010a}.
% this report
This report describes the Tabu Search algorithm using the standardized template.

% Name
% The algorithm name defines the canonical name used to refer to the technique, in addition to common aliases, abbreviations, and acronyms. The name is used in terms of the heading and sub-headings of an algorithm description.
\section{Name} 
\label{sec:name}
% What is the canonical name and common aliases for a technique?
% What are the common abbreviations and acronyms for a technique?
% The heading and alternate headings for the algorithm description.
Tabu Search, TS

% Taxonomy: Lineage and locality
% The algorithm taxonomy defines where a techniques fits into the field, both the specific subfields of Computational Intelligence and Biologically Inspired Computation as well as the broader field of Artificial Intelligence. The taxonomy also provides a context for determining the relation- ships between algorithms. The taxonomy may be described in terms of a series of relationship statements or pictorially as a venn diagram or a graph with hierarchical structure.
\section{Taxonomy}
\label{sec:taxonomy}
% To what fields of study does a technique belong?
Tabu Search is a Global Optimization algorithm and a Metaheuristic or Meta-strategy for controlling an embedded heuristic technique. 
% What are the closely related approaches to a technique?
Tabu Search is a parent for a large family of derivative approaches that introduce memory structures in Metaheuristics, such as Reactive Tabu Search and Parallel Tabu Search.

% Strategy: Problem solving plan
% The strategy is an abstract description of the computational model. The strategy describes the information processing actions a technique shall take in order to achieve an objective. The strategy provides a logical separation between a computational realization (procedure) and a analogous system (metaphor). A given problem solving strategy may be realized as one of a number specific algorithms or problem solving systems. The strategy description is textual using information processing and algorithmic terminology.
\section{Strategy}
\label{sec:strategy}
% What is the information processing objective of a technique?
% What is a techniques plan of action?
todo

% Procedure: Abstract computation
% The algorithmic procedure summarizes the specifics of realizing a strategy as a systemized and parameterized computation. It outlines how the algorithm is organized in terms of the data structures and representations. The procedure may be described in terms of software engineering and computer science artifacts such as pseudo code, design diagrams, and relevant mathematical equations.
\section{Procedure}
\label{sec:procedure}
% What is the computational recipe for a technique?
% What are the data structures and representations used in a technique?
Algorithm~\ref{alg:tabu_search} provides a pseudo-code listing of the Tabu Search algorithm for minimizing a cost function.

% Heuristics: Usage guidelines
% The heuristics element describe the commonsense, best practice, and demonstrated rules for applying and configuring a parameterized algorithm. The heuristics relate to the technical details of the techniques procedure and data structures for general classes of application (neither specific implementations not specific problem instances). The heuristics are described textually, such as a series of guidelines in a bullet-point structure.
\section{Heuristics}
\label{sec:heuristics}
% What are the suggested configurations for a technique?
% What are the guidelines for the application of a technique to a problem instance?

\begin{itemize}
	\item intermediate memory (recency) can be used to focus the search on interesting areas of the search space (intensification)
	\item long term memory can be used to encourage more useful exploration (diversification) - forcing new solutions with rarely used components, add biases away from the most commonly used components such as based on overall usage frequencies
	\item candidates may be selected deterministically (entire neighborhood) or stochastically with a fixed size (trade-off of accuracy and efficiency)
\end{itemize}

% The code description provides a minimal but functional version of the technique implemented with a programming language. The code description must be able to be typed into an appropriate computer, compiled or interpreted as need be, and provide a working execution of the technique. The technique implementation also includes a minimal problem instance to which it is applied, and both the problem and algorithm implementations are complete enough to demonstrate the techniques procedure. The description is presented as a programming source code listing.
\section{Code Listing}
\label{sec:code}
% How is a technique implemented as an executable program?
% How is a technique applied to a concrete problem instance?
Listing~\ref{tabu_search} provides an example of the Iterated Local Search algorithm implemented in the Ruby Programming Language. 
% problem
The algorithm is applied to the Berlin52 instance of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), taken from the TSPLIB. The problem seeks a permutation of the order to visit cities (called a tour) that minimized the total distance traveled. The optimal tour distance for Berlin52 instance is 7542 units.

% algorithm
seminal papers on tabu search for TSP: Knox \cite{Knox1994} based on his dissertation work
considering a parallel version \cite{Fiechter1994}


initialized with a stochastic local search - stochastic 2-opt
it is about the moves made by the search. tabu the edges that are deleted in a 2-opt so they cannot be re-added again for a while
neighborhood is stochastic - 2-opt moves
fixed tabu list size
fixed candidate list size
simple tabu search

% References: Deeper understanding
% The references element description includes a listing of both primary sources of information about the technique as well as useful introductory sources for novices to gain a deeper understanding of the theory and application of the technique. The description consists of hand-selected reference material including books, peer reviewed conference papers, journal articles, and potentially websites. A bullet-pointed structure is suggested.

NOTES
\begin{itemize}
	\item adds memory to the search, penalizes exploring the same solutions in the search space, encourages exploration
	\item proposed to prevent cycling of candidate solutions when using a local search with restart (multi-search)
	\item tabu list - memory of solutions visited, or components, held for a fixed tabu tenure 
	\item can have short, medium, and long term memory added to the search
	\item designed for combinatorial optimization
	\item focuses of components or attributes of solutions
	\item flexible memory structures, strategic restrictions, aspiration levels
	\item it is a technique for improving the efficiency of the search, also escaping local optima
