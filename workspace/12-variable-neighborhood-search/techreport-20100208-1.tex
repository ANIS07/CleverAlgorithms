\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec:intro}
% project
The Clever Algorithms project aims to describe a large number of algorithms from the fields of Computational Intelligence, Biologically Inspired Computation, and Metaheuristics in a complete, consistent and centralized manner \cite{Brownlee2010}.
% description
The project requires all algorithms to be described using a standardized template that includes a fixed number of sections, each of which is motivated by the presentation of specific information about the technique \cite{Brownlee2010a}.
% this report
This report describes the Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm using the standardized template.

% Name
% The algorithm name defines the canonical name used to refer to the technique, in addition to common aliases, abbreviations, and acronyms. The name is used in terms of the heading and sub-headings of an algorithm description.
\section{Name} 
\label{sec:name}
% What is the canonical name and common aliases for a technique?
% What are the common abbreviations and acronyms for a technique?
% The heading and alternate headings for the algorithm description.
Variable Neighborhood Search, VNS

% Taxonomy: Lineage and locality
% The algorithm taxonomy defines where a techniques fits into the field, both the specific subfields of Computational Intelligence and Biologically Inspired Computation as well as the broader field of Artificial Intelligence. The taxonomy also provides a context for determining the relation- ships between algorithms. The taxonomy may be described in terms of a series of relationship statements or pictorially as a venn diagram or a graph with hierarchical structure.

% Strategy: Problem solving plan
% The strategy is an abstract description of the computational model. The strategy describes the information processing actions a technique shall take in order to achieve an objective. The strategy provides a logical separation between a computational realization (procedure) and a analogous system (metaphor). A given problem solving strategy may be realized as one of a number specific algorithms or problem solving systems. The strategy description is textual using information processing and algorithmic terminology.
\section{Strategy}
\label{sec:strategy}
% What is the information processing objective of a technique?
% What is a techniques plan of action?
todo

% Procedure: Abstract computation
% The algorithmic procedure summarizes the specifics of realizing a strategy as a systemized and parameterized computation. It outlines how the algorithm is organized in terms of the data structures and representations. The procedure may be described in terms of software engineering and computer science artifacts such as pseudo code, design diagrams, and relevant mathematical equations.
\section{Procedure}
\label{sec:procedure}
% What is the computational recipe for a technique?
% What are the data structures and representations used in a technique?
Algorithm~\ref{alg:variable_neighborhood_search} provides a pseudo-code listing of the Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm for minimizing a cost function.

% Heuristics: Usage guidelines
% The heuristics element describe the commonsense, best practice, and demonstrated rules for applying and configuring a parameterized algorithm. The heuristics relate to the technical details of the techniques procedure and data structures for general classes of application (neither specific implementations not specific problem instances). The heuristics are described textually, such as a series of guidelines in a bullet-point structure.
\section{Heuristics}
\label{sec:heuristics}
% What are the suggested configurations for a technique?
% What are the guidelines for the application of a technique to a problem instance?

\end{itemize}

% The code description provides a minimal but functional version of the technique implemented with a programming language. The code description must be able to be typed into an appropriate computer, compiled or interpreted as need be, and provide a working execution of the technique. The technique implementation also includes a minimal problem instance to which it is applied, and both the problem and algorithm implementations are complete enough to demonstrate the techniques procedure. The description is presented as a programming source code listing.
\section{Code Listing}
\label{sec:code}
% How is a technique implemented as an executable program?
% How is a technique applied to a concrete problem instance?
Listing~\ref{variable_neighborhood_search} provides an example of the Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm implemented in the Ruby Programming Language.

% References: Deeper understanding
% The references element description includes a listing of both primary sources of information about the technique as well as useful introductory sources for novices to gain a deeper understanding of the theory and application of the technique. The description consists of hand-selected reference material including books, peer reviewed conference papers, journal articles, and potentially websites. A bullet-pointed structure is suggested.

notes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item for constrained non-linear programming problems (continuous function optimization)
	\item iterative explores neighborhoods of growing size - locates a local optima, keeps searching and expanding neighborhood size until an improved local optima is found, then the process is repeated
	\item applied to continuous and combinatorial problems
	\item makes use of a local search technique, should be problem specific - this is a metaheuristic for global search that uses a local search
	\item define sets of neighbors, explore each one, escape local optima, locate global optima
	\item appears to perform a stochastic local search in each neighborhood (shaking), then refine (local search), accept change only if it is improvement (acceptance criteria)
	\item motivated by (quoted): A local minimum with respect to one neighbourhood structure is not necessary so for another; A global minimum is a local minimum with respect to all possible neighbourhood structures.  For many problems local minima with respect to one or several neighbourhoods are relatively close to each other.
	\item the benefit of VNS seems to come from the fact that local optima are empirically commonly close to global optima n some problems under some neighbourhood types - a fact exploited by reduced VNS (RVNS) - generalized case is called basic VNS (BVNS)
	\item a fixed neighbourhood results in a procedure that resembles Iterated Local Search

Are you an expert in this technique and know some facts that could improve the algorithm description for all?
% incentive
Do you want to get that warm feeling from contributing to an open source project? 
Do you want to see your name as an acknowledgment in print?

%  ideal
Two pillars of this effort are i) that the best domain experts are people outside of the project, and ii) that this work is wrong by default.
