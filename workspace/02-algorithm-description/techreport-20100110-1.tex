\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%  project
The Clever Algorithm Project is concerned with the complete, consistent, and centralized description of algorithms from the fields of Computational Intelligence and Biologically Inspired Computation to ensure that they are accessible, usable, and understandable \cite{Brownlee2010}.
% this report
This report provides an exploration and definition of the standardized structure for algorithm descriptions in the project.

% breakdown
Section~\ref{sec:elements} provides a summary of algorithm description elements that may be used in a standardized algorithm description template. Section~\ref{sec:template} proposes a template with specific description elements and expectations as to how the template should be adopted and refined.

\section{Descriptive Elements}
\label{sec:elements}
This section provides a summary of descriptive elements that may form apart of a standardized algorithm description. Each element is motivated by the speculated needs of the target audience.

\subsection{Name}
todo

\subsection{Inspiration}
the system that provoked the algorithm

\subsection{Metaphor}
allegory for explaining the computation

\subsection{Strategy}
the abstracted computation in terms of information processing

\subsection{Procedure}
equations, operations, and pseudo code descriptions of the computation

\subsection{Heuristics}
best practices and rules of thumb for configuring a parameterized algorithm

\subsection{Applications}
the general and/or specific domains the technique has been applied or is suited

\subsection{History}
the dates and people behind the development and progression of the technique

\subsection{Further Reading}
sources of information to seek if more detail is required

\subsection{Sample}
complete source code listing

\subsection{Tutorial}
source code listing presented as a narrative


\section{Standardized Description} 
\label{sec:template}
This section proposes a standardized algorithm template that includes some of the elements drawn from Section~\ref{sec:elements}. 

\subsection{Algorithm Description Template}
This section proposes a standardized algorithm description template to be completed by all algorithms described in the Clever Algorithms project.

todo: insert a table of template section and the expectation of what the section should contain.

\subsection{Template Usage}
how should the template be used? are all sections required?

\subsection{A Living Standard}
The proposed template should be considered a first draft of a standard that is expected to be refined through adoption and use throughout the execution of the Clever Algorithms project. The final version of this standard that the project converges to will be used for all algorithms described in the projects compendium to ensure the objective of consistency is met. This constraint is suggested, but not required for the algorithms described workspace during content development.
