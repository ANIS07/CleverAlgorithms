\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%  project
The Clever Algorithm Project is concerned with the complete, consistent, and centralized description of algorithms from the fields of Computational Intelligence and Biologically Inspired Computation to ensure that they are accessible, usable, and understandable \cite{Brownlee2010}.
% this report
This report provides an exploration and definition of the standardized structure for algorithm descriptions in the project.

% breakdown
Section~\ref{sec:elements} provides a summary of algorithm description elements that may be used in a standardized algorithm description template. Section~\ref{sec:examples} demonstrates the usage of the description elements against three popular algorithmic techniques. Section~\ref{sec:template} proposes a template with specific description elements and expectations as to how the template should be adopted and refined.

\section{Descriptive Elements}
\label{sec:elements}
This section provides a summary of descriptive elements that may form apart of a standardized algorithm description. Each element is 1) defined, 2) specifies the intended nature of an instantiated description (such as size, scope and form), and 3) specifies two questions that motivate the content for the element.

\subsection{Name}
The algorithm name defines the canonical name used to refer to the technique, in addition to common aliases, abbreviations, and acronyms. The name is described in terms of the heading and sub-headings of an algorithm.

\begin{itemize}
	% names
	\item \emph{What is the canonical name and common aliases for a technique?}
	% short names
	\item \emph{What are the common abbreviations and acronyms for a technique?}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Taxonomy: Lineage and locality}
The algorithm taxonomy defines where a techniques fits into the field, both the specific subfields of Computational Intelligence and Biologically Inspired Computation as well as the broader field of Artificial Intelligence. The taxonomy also provides a context for determining the relationships between algorithms. The taxonomy may be described in terms of a series of relationship statements or pictorially as a venn diagram or a graph with hierarchical structure.

\begin{itemize}
	% membership
	\item \emph{To what fields of study does a technique belong?}
	% inter-relationship
	\item \emph{What are closely related techniques to a technique?}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Inspiration: Motivating system}
The inspiration describes the specific system or process that provoked the inception of the algorithm. The inspiring system may be natural, biological, physical, or social. The description of the inspiring system may include relevant domain specific theory, observation, nomenclature, and most important must include those salient attributes of the system that are somehow abstractly or conceptually manifest in the technique. The inspiration is described textually with source and may include diagrams to highlight features and relationships within the inspiring system.

\begin{itemize}
	% description
	\item \emph{What is the system that motivated the development of a technique?}
	% scope
	\item \emph{Which features of the motivating system are relevant to a technique?}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Metaphor: Explanation via analogy}
The metaphor is a description of the technique in the context of the inspiring system or a different suitable system. The features of the technique are made apparent through an analogous description of the features of the inspiring system. The explanation through analogy is not expected to be literal scientific truth, rather the method is used as an allegorical communication tool. The inspiring system is not explicitly described, this is the role of the `inspiration' element, which represents a loose dependency for this element. The explanation is textual and uses the nomenclature of the metaphorical system. 

\begin{itemize}
	% metaphor (how does it work)
	\item \emph{What is the explanation of a technique in the context of the inspiring system?}
	% analogy (what can it do)
	\item \emph{What are the functionalities inferred for a technique from the analogous inspiring system?}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Strategy: Problem solving plan}
The strategy is an abstract description of the computational model. The strategy describes the information processing actions a technique shall take in order to achieve an objective. The strategy provides a logical separation between a computational realization (procedure) and a analogous system (metaphor). A given problem solving strategy may be realized as one of a number specific algorithms or problem solving systems. The strategy description is textual using objective information processing and algorithmic terminology.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{What is a techniques plan of action?}
	\item \emph{What are the information processing properties of a technique?}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Procedure: Abstract computation}
The algorithm procedure summarizes the specifics of realizing the strategy as a systemized and parameterized computation. It outlines how the algorithm is organized in terms of the data structures and adopted representations. The procedure may be described in terms of software engineering and computer science artifacts such as pseudo code, design diagrams, and relevant mathematical equations.

\begin{itemize}
	% recipe
	\item \emph{What is the computational recipe for a technique?}
	% data
	\item \emph{What are the data structures and representations used in a technique?}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Heuristics: Usage guidelines}
The heuristics describe the commonsense, best practice, and demonstrated rules for applying and configuring a parameterized algorithm. The heuristics relate to technical details of the techniques procedure and data structures for general classes of application (neither specific implementations not specific problem instances). The heuristics are described textually, such as a series of guidelines in a bullet-point structure.

\begin{itemize}
	% parameters
	\item \emph{What are the suggested configurations for a technique?}
	% application
	\item \emph{What are the guidelines for the application of a technique to a problem instance?}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Applications: Demonstrated usage}
The applications describes the general classes problem problem to which the technique has been applied or to which the technique is well suited. The description may also include descriptions of specific problem instances that represent archetypal applications of the technique. The description of the applications is textual, likely with supporting references, potentially in a table structure. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{What are the suggested classes of problems for which a technique is suited?}
	\item \emph{What are some exemplar problem instances to which a technique has been applied?}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{History: Inception and development}
The history describes the inception of the technique including the original sources and the authors and contributors. The description also covers the subsequent and/or parallel development of the technique and the relevant original sources and contributors. The description may be textual with citations, and a timeline structure may be appropriate.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Under what conditions was a technique originally proposed?}
	\item \emph{What were the significant milestones in the development of a technique?}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Further Reading: Deeper understanding}
The further reading description includes a listing of both primary sources of information about the technique as well as useful introductory sources for novices to gain a deeper understanding of the theory and application of the technique. The description consists of hand-selected reference material including books, peer reviewed conference papers, journal articles, and potentially websites. A bullet-pointed structure is well suited. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{What are the primary sources for a technique?}
	\item \emph{What are the suggested reference sources for learning more about a technique?}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Source Code: Operational realization}
complete source code listing
a technique is not understood until is implemented and seen running, observing and manipulating the effects of these things is where the real work is 

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{How is a technique implemented as an executable program?}
	\item \emph{How is a technique applied to an actual problem instance?}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tutorial}
source code listing presented as a narrative. example of realizing the approach on a problem - demonstrate strategy, realize the procedure, manifest the heuristics

Tutorials are complete in that they result in a functional program, although they are demonstrative, implementing only just enough features to demonstrate a specific technique on a specific problem instance. They provide an exemplar realization of the technique suitable for demonstrating the fine details of the technique, and a template for specializing the technique for practical problem solving. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{What is the rationale when implementing a technique as an executable program?}
	\item \emph{What is the rationale when applying a technique to an actual problem instance?}
\end{itemize}

\section{Examples} 
\label{sec:examples}
This section elaborates the elements of a standardized algorithm description presented in Section~\ref{sec:elements} by briefly summarizing how three popular algorithms from the fields of Computational Intelligence and Biologically Inspired Computation may be described (in the simplest possible form).

\section{Standardized Description} 
\label{sec:template}
This section proposes a standardized algorithm template that includes some of the elements drawn from Section~\ref{sec:elements}.

\subsection{Template Composition}
need a mixture of abstraction and concreteness, need a mixture of narrative, programatic and potentially even diagrammatic 

\subsection{Algorithm Description Template}
Table~\ref{tab:template} contains a standardized algorithm description template to be completed by all algorithms described in the Clever Algorithms project.

\begin{table}[ht]
	\centering
		\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
		\toprule
		\textbf{Element} & \textbf{Description} \\ 
		\toprule
		\emph{Name} & The heading and alternate headings for the algorithm description.  \\ 
		\midrule
		\emph{Further Reading} & An annotated reference list of followup resources. \\
		\bottomrule
		\end{tabularx}	
	\caption{Standardized algorithm description template.}
	\label{tab:template}
\end{table}

\subsection{Template Usage}
how should the template be used? are all sections required? little of the information is provided in an appropriate format, most likely the hard work will be formulating the elements of the description for each algorithm
not really separable all the time

\subsection{A Living Standard}
The proposed template should be considered a first draft of a standard that is expected to be refined through adoption and use throughout the execution of the Clever Algorithms project. The final version of this standard that the project converges to will be used for all algorithms described in the projects compendium to ensure the objective of consistency is met. This constraint is suggested, but not required for the algorithms described workspace during content development.
