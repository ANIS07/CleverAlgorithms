\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
% project
The Clever Algorithms project aims to describe a large number of algorithms from the field of Artificial Intelligence in a complete, consistent, and centralized way to improve the accessibility of the methods \cite{Brownlee2010}.

the selection and organization of algorithms that appear in the book is a very big deal, it may even be more important than the algorithm descriptions themselves.

% Methodology
% 
\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}
This section describes the methodology for the selection of algorithms for inclusion in the Clever Algorithms project.

This methodology and its results are based on a blog post by Jason Brownlee on August 2nd 2009 entitled ``What is a good optimization algorithm? A data-driven method for algorithm selection'' located at: \url{http://www.neverreadpassively.com/2009/08/what-is-good-optimization-algorithm.html}.

The previous method was based on the question: \emph{Is it possible to select a diverse, interesting, and useful set of inspired algorithms using a simple data driven method?}

% Algorithm List
% 
\subsection{Algorithm List}
prepare an algorithm list. include name, parent field
draw from lots of fields, such as computational intelligence algorithms, metaheuristics, biologically inspired algorithms, natural algorithms, biomimetic algorithms
draw from lots of sources: books, websites, papers, articles, friends


Normalized algorithm names to their full unabbreviated form. No acronyms wherever reasonably possible.

Assigned each algorithm a superficial grouping or kingdom (I thought for use in a book chapter structure) based on general observation and intuition. Kingdom names were generally based on the motivation for the methods strategy, including: evolutionary, immunological, swarm, physical, probabilistic, and stochastic.

representative of the field

problems
not all algorithms are equal, some are more heuristics than true procedures
not all have well defined names
algorithms are renamed
self references boost numbers
time of publication, new algorithms get lower ranks, older get higher

% Rank Algorithms
% 
\subsection{Rank Algorithms}
some nice data points would include: objective efficiency, efficacy, quality of research, and maybe even scope of innovation

simple ranking principle: \emph{An algorithm or method is as good its name, as useful and interesting as it is abundant.}

more specifically: An algorithm that is used (written about) is an algorithm that is useful (worth knowing about).

tally the number of search results for an algorithm across a number of domains

Recorded the estimated-total number of search results for the exact algorithm name (quoted) in Google Web Search, Google Scholar Search, Google Book Search, Springer Search, and Scirus Search.

Calculated the relative algorithm rank metric as the sum of the normalized search result measures.

% Select Algorithms
% 
\subsection{Select Algorithms}
order by rank, filter for interestingness
organize by field or sub-field or some commonality

list in order of increasing complexity, a logical narrative perhaps

% Results
% 
\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
This section summarizes the results of assessing algorithms for inclusion in the Clever Algorithms project.

i focused on `unconventional optimization algorithms', leaving out so-called model building approaches from statistical machine learning such as artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, kernels, etc 

not out of the project for good, just out for now - perhaps a two volume study? algorithms and models

Top overall?
Top for each field?
list all results? good for completeness 

% 
% Analysis
% 
\section{Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}
This section analyses the results of the assessed algorithms for inclusion in the Clever Algorithms project.

common base names boosting some algorithms, like the ga


\section{Selected Algorithms}
\label{sec:selection}
This section provides a listing of 50 algorithms selected for description in the Clever Algorithms Project. The presentation of this list of algorithms is partitioned into sub-domains that are expected to represent Chapters in the final work. Each algorithm is listed with at least one primary or seminal source to verify the existence of the approach.

not final, just a first best guess based on available information
composition must be large, diverse, interesting. 
selection based on a filtered version of the ranked listings

\subsection{Stochastic Algorithms}

\subsection{Evolutionary Algorithms}

\subsection{Swarm Algorithms}

\subsection{Immune Algorithms}

\subsection{Probabilistic Algorithms}

\subsection{Physical Algorithms}


% summarise the document message and areas for future consideration
\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
This is the conclusion. Consider summarizing the message of the document once again, and highlighting areas for future consideration.

The project now has preliminary algorithm chapters and sections.
this does not have to be maintained, it is just a first attempt at outlining the scope of the project
