\section*{Abstract} 
% project
The Clever Algorithms project aims to describe a large number of Artificial Intelligence algorithms in a complete, consistent, and centralized manner, to improve their general accessibility. 
% template
The project makes use of a standardized algorithm description template that uses well-defined topics that motivate the collection of specific and useful information about each algorithm described.
% stochastic
The second batch of ten algorithms for the project have been described, all of which are classified as Evolutionary Algorithms under the adopted algorithm taxonomy.
% best practices
This report provides a point of reflection on the preparation of the second ten algorithms to be described for the Clever Algorithms project and summarizes the findings, lessons learned, and recommends some best practices for going forward with the project.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
% project
The Clever Algorithms project aims to describe a large number of algorithms from the fields of Computational Intelligence, Biologically Inspired Computation, and Metaheuristics in a complete, consistent and centralized manner \cite{Brownlee2010}.
% description
The project requires all algorithms to be described using a standardized template that includes a fixed number of sections, each of which is motivated by the presentation of specific information about the technique \cite{Brownlee2010a}.
% this report
This report provides an overview of the Evolutionary Algorithms in the Clever Algorithms project. 
Section~\ref{sec:algorithms} provides background information and reviews common themes for the general class of algorithm and summarizes those evolutionary algorithms that have been described for the Clever Algorithms Project.
Section~\ref{sec:outcomes} summarizes the findings from preparing the evolutionary algorithm descriptions, and lists a number of recommendations for both describing algorithms in the future and the modification of the existing algorithm descriptions for inclusion in the Clever Algorithms book and web page.

% Background
% 
\subsection{Background}
% broadly
The algorithms to be described in the Clever Algorithms project are drawn from a diverse set of subfields of Artificial Intelligence, such as Computational Intelligence, Biologically Inspired Computation, and Metaheuristics. The majority of the algorithms selected for description in the project are optimization algorithms \cite{Brownlee2010b}. 
% unconventional
This collection of selected algorithms have been referred to as Unconventional Optimization algorithms in order to differentiate them from the more traditional deterministic approaches from operations research and mathematical programming such as Nelder-Mead method \cite{Brownlee2010n}. So-called unconventional optimization algorithms are characterized by the incorporation of stochastic and probabilistic processes and the heuristic or approximate (sub-optimal) nature of the solutions that are designed to achieve. As such, these algorithms can be understood by topics such as black box methods, stochastic optimization, and inductive learning (refer to Brownlee \cite{Brownlee2010n}). 

% specific
The ten algorithms that have been described for the Clever Algorithms project are referred to as Evolutionary Algorithms. They are differentiated from the remainder of the algorithms described in the project that have been designated a taxonomy including stochastic, swarm, probabilistic, physical, and immune algorithms \cite{Brownlee2010b}.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
% overview
This report provided a point of reflection for the second batch of ten algorithm descriptions prepared for the Clever Algorithms project. All described algorithms were assigned to the `Evolutionary Algorithms' kingdom in the chosen algorithm taxonomy. This report highlighted the commonality for all described Evolutionary Algorithms and provided a definition suitable for use in the proposed book and website.
%  forward
The report provided a summary of the interesting findings identified in the preparation of the algorithm descriptions, and provided a set of recommendations for going forward both with future algorithm descriptions and with regard to migrating the existing descriptions into the Clever Algorithms book and website mediums.
