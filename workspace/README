A workspace for developing content for the Clever Algorithms book by Jason Brownlee.

JabRef is proposed for managing the bibtex: http://jabref.sourceforge.net/

Provides a collection of notes and technical reports, organized into directories by topic/report. The methodology for content development involves the completion of a large number of small (2-4 man days), discrete, independent, formal reports on topics in or about the book that may be further developed or incorporated directly into the book itself. It is a methodology that promotes the prolonged capture of ad hoc and dis-contiguous effort to support project momentum and motivation through the production of tangible work product that contributes to the project objective.

This methodology worked very well for me in the past while working on my PhD project, see:
