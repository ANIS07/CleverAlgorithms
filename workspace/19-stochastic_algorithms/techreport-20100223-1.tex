\section*{Abstract} 
% project
The Clever Algorithms project aims to describe a large number of Artificial Intelligence algorithms in a complete, consistent, and centralized manner, to improve their general accessibility. 
% template
The project makes use of a standardized algorithm description template that uses well-defined topics that motivate the collection of specific and useful information about each algorithm described.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
% project
The Clever Algorithms project aims to describe a large number of algorithms from the fields of Computational Intelligence, Biologically Inspired Computation, and Metaheuristics in a complete, consistent and centralized manner \cite{Brownlee2010}.
% description
The project requires all algorithms to be described using a standardized template that includes a fixed number of sections, each of which is motivated by the presentation of specific information about the technique \cite{Brownlee2010a}.
% this report
This report provides an overview of the Stochastic Algorithms in the Clever Algorithms project. 
Section~\ref{sec:algorithms} provides background information and reviews common themes for general class of algorithm and summarizes those stochastic algorithms that have been described for the Clever Algorithms Project.
Section~\ref{sec:outcomes} summarizes the findings from preparing the stochastic algorithm descriptions, and lists a number of recommendations for both describing algorithms in the future and the modification of the existing algorithm descriptions for inclusion in the Clever Algorithms book and web page.

% overview
This section summarizes the stochastic algorithms currently described for inclusion in the Clever Algorithms project. It is proposed that these algorithms will collectively comprise a chapter in the Clever Algorithms book.

\subsection{Findings}

what was found while preparing the algorithms

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Change of Selected Algorithms}: A  collection of 10 stochastic algorithms were previously identified and chosen to be described in the Clever Algorithms project \cite{Brownlee2010b}. One algorithms on that list were removed (Reactive search optimization) and replaced with an alternative (Iterated Local Search). Also, the `Hill Climbing Search' algorithm was renamed to `Stochastic Hill Climbing' to align the technique with the theme of stochastic optimization algorithms.
	\item \textbf{Additional Algorithm Name}: Many algorithm names were discovered in the preparation of the technical reports. The total number of stochastic algorithms listed in the original algorithm name assessment was 23. This number has ballooned to 52 at the time of writing.
	\item \textbf{Variable Algorithm Difficulty}: some algorithms are a snap to interpret, other take many days
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Recommendations}

what should change going forward?

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Consistent Problem Instances}: present general problem classes early and use consistently throughout all algorithm descriptions (tsp - berlin52 and func opt - basin)
	\item \textbf{Local and Global Search}: introductory material should cover local and global search strategies, neighborhoods, etc
	\item \textbf{Review}: code review of implementations, technique review by experts - want to be as useful as possible
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
% overview
This report provided a point of reflection for the first 10 algorithm descriptions prepared for the Clever Algorithms project. All described algorithms were assigned to the `Stochastic Algorithms' kingdom in the Clever Algorithms project. This report highlighted the commonality for all described stochastic algorithms and provided a definition suitable for use in the proposed book and website.
%  forward
The report provided a summary of the interesting findings identified in the preparation of the algorithm descriptions, and provided a set of recommendations for going forward both with future algorithm descriptions and with regard to migrating the existing descriptions into the Clever Algorithms book and website mediums.
