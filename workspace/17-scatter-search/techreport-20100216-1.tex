\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec:intro}
% project
The Clever Algorithms project aims to describe a large number of algorithms from the fields of Computational Intelligence, Biologically Inspired Computation, and Metaheuristics in a complete, consistent and centralized manner \cite{Brownlee2010}.
% description
The project requires all algorithms to be described using a standardized template that includes a fixed number of sections, each of which is motivated by the presentation of specific information about the technique \cite{Brownlee2010a}.
% this report
This report describes the Scatter Search algorithm using the standardized template.

% Name
% The algorithm name defines the canonical name used to refer to the technique, in addition to common aliases, abbreviations, and acronyms. The name is used in terms of the heading and sub-headings of an algorithm description.
\section{Name} 
\label{sec:name}
% What is the canonical name and common aliases for a technique?
% What are the common abbreviations and acronyms for a technique?
% The heading and alternate headings for the algorithm description.
Scatter Search, SS

% Taxonomy: Lineage and locality
% The algorithm taxonomy defines where a techniques fits into the field, both the specific subfields of Computational Intelligence and Biologically Inspired Computation as well as the broader field of Artificial Intelligence. The taxonomy also provides a context for determining the relation- ships between algorithms. The taxonomy may be described in terms of a series of relationship statements or pictorially as a venn diagram or a graph with hierarchical structure.
\section{Taxonomy}
\label{sec:taxonomy}
% To what fields of study does a technique belong?
Scatter search is a Metaheuristic and a Global Optimization algorithm. It is also sometimes associated with the field of Evolutionary Computation given some of the similarities in the structure of the technique.
% What are the closely related approaches to a technique?
Scatter Search is a sibling of Tabu Search, developed by the same author and based on similar principles.

% Strategy: Problem solving plan
% The strategy is an abstract description of the computational model. The strategy describes the information processing actions a technique shall take in order to achieve an objective. The strategy provides a logical separation between a computational realization (procedure) and a analogous system (metaphor). A given problem solving strategy may be realized as one of a number specific algorithms or problem solving systems. The strategy description is textual using information processing and algorithmic terminology.
\section{Strategy}
\label{sec:strategy}
% What is the information processing objective of a technique?
The objective of Scatter Search is to maintain a set of diverse and high-quality candidate solutions.
% What is a techniques plan of action?
The strategy involves the explicit preparation of an initial set of diverse and high-quality candidate solutions that are partitioned into subsets and linearly recombined, the results of which are refined using an embedded heuristic and assessed in the context of the maintained set of solutions as to whether or not they are retained. 

% Procedure: Abstract computation
% The algorithmic procedure summarizes the specifics of realizing a strategy as a systemized and parameterized computation. It outlines how the algorithm is organized in terms of the data structures and representations. The procedure may be described in terms of software engineering and computer science artifacts such as pseudo code, design diagrams, and relevant mathematical equations.
\section{Procedure}
\label{sec:procedure}
% What is the computational recipe for a technique?
% What are the data structures and representations used in a technique?
Algorithm~\ref{alg:scatter_search} provides a pseudo-code listing of the Scatter Search algorithm for minimizing a cost function, based on the abstract form presented by Glover as a template for the general class of technique \cite{Glover1998a} with influence from an application to function optimization by Glover \cite{Glover1998a}.

% Heuristics: Usage guidelines
% The heuristics element describe the commonsense, best practice, and demonstrated rules for applying and configuring a parameterized algorithm. The heuristics relate to the technical details of the techniques procedure and data structures for general classes of application (neither specific implementations not specific problem instances). The heuristics are described textually, such as a series of guidelines in a bullet-point structure.
\section{Heuristics}
\label{sec:heuristics}
% What are the suggested configurations for a technique?
% What are the guidelines for the application of a technique to a problem instance?
\begin{itemize}
	\item prefer small population sizes (such as  $\leq 20$ solutions or less)
	\item recombination can use two or more solutions
	\item recombination should promote good solutions, rather than crossover in ga that is random (guy has no clue)
	\item a lack of changes to the reference set is a good stopping condition
	\item diversification is concerned with diversity of the set, no objective function evaluations
	\item set selection: 1: all 2-pair sets or random pairs, 2: 1 plus best not in set, 3: 2 plus best not in set, 4: 5 best elements in set
\end{itemize}

% The code description provides a minimal but functional version of the technique implemented with a programming language. The code description must be able to be typed into an appropriate computer, compiled or interpreted as need be, and provide a working execution of the technique. The technique implementation also includes a minimal problem instance to which it is applied, and both the problem and algorithm implementations are complete enough to demonstrate the techniques procedure. The description is presented as a programming source code listing.
\section{Code Listing}
\label{sec:code}
% How is a technique implemented as an executable program?
% How is a technique applied to a concrete problem instance?
Listing~\ref{scatter_search} provides an example of the Scatter Search algorithm implemented in the Ruby Programming Language. 

an example of a practical explanation of scatter search applied to TSP and compared with the GA \cite{Marti2005}

template approach describes core algorithms with binary string based examples \cite{Glover1998a}

overview of technique, presentation with application to nonlinear programming (binary strings i think) \cite{Glover2003b}
tutorial for unconstrained non-linear optimization problems
initial solutions are a stratified sample of the search space


% problem
% The algorithm is applied to the Berlin52 instance of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), taken from the TSPLIB. The problem seeks a permutation of the order to visit cities (called a tour) that minimized the total distance traveled. The optimal tour distance for Berlin52 instance is 7542 units.

% algorithm
implemented the two short cuts - no restart and no diversity maintenance
can add these back in as heuristics during application

using random step size as the local search
using random point to initialize the set

% References: Deeper understanding
% The references element description includes a listing of both primary sources of information about the technique as well as useful introductory sources for novices to gain a deeper understanding of the theory and application of the technique. The description consists of hand-selected reference material including books, peer reviewed conference papers, journal articles, and potentially websites. A bullet-pointed structure is suggested.

NOTES
\begin{itemize}
	\item general form is called path relinking (different technique?), claimed to be an evolutionary method
	\item for combinatorial optimization as well as non-linear programming 
	\item a population-based approach - maintains a set of `reference solutions' - algorithm operates on a reference set, generating new solutions that are assessed, some of which replace members of the reference set
	\item uses a linear crossover algorithm to create new samples
	\item selects two or more candidates from the reference set to create a new sample
	\item can partition the reference set into tiers, apply rules for recombining from different tiers, as well as replacement
	\item combinations are designed to create weighted centroids of defined sub-regions
\end{itemize}

principles
\begin{itemize}
	\item useful information about the optima is stored in multiple elite solutions (reference set)
	\item recombine elite examples to exploit such information
	\item recombination process must be able to explore within the region of elite solutions as well as out side it (diversity and quality)
	\item combine many elite solutions together - exploits more information
\end{itemize}

what is path relinking? why is it relevant? \cite{Glover1994a} - combining, also introducing path relinking strategy
\begin{itemize}
	\item linear combinations of solutions - paths between solutions
	\item paths in neighborhood space, rather than Euclidean space
	\item an alternative and more flexible way of navigating a neighborhood space than the traditional one-move on a graph approach
	
\end{itemize}

	\item overview, fundamentals of SS and path linking \cite{Glover2000} very much like the template paper
	\item another generic overview paper - perhaps more recent \cite{Martia2006} review chapter
	\item another generic presentation, knapsack problem demo \cite{Laguna2002} review chapter
