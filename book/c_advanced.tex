\chapter{Advanced Topics}
\label{ch:advanced}
This chapter provides discussion on a number of advanced topics that may be considered once one or more of the algorithms described in this book have been mastered.

The topics in this section consider some practical concerns such as: How to implement an algorithm using a different programming paradigm (Section~\ref{advanced:sec:paradigms}), How to devise and investigate a new biologically inspired algorithm (Section~\ref{advanced:sec:new_algorithms}), How to test algorithm implementations to ensure they are implemented correctly (Section~\ref{advanced:sec:testing_algorithms}), How to visualize problems, algorithm behavior and candidate solutions (Section~\ref{advanced:sec:visualizing_algorithms}), How to direct these algorithms toward practical problem solving (Section~\ref{advanced:sec:problem_solving}), and Issues to consider when benchmarking and comparing the capabilities of algorithms (Section~\ref{advanced:sec:racing_algorithms}).

The hope of this chapter is to provide some suggestion at the concerns and skills necessary for taking the algorithms described in this book into the real-world.
