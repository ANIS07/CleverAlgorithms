\chapter{Advanced Topics}
\label{ch:advanced}
A chapter focused on applying, testing, visualizing, saving results, and comparing algorithms. The meta concerns once an algorithm is selected for a given practical problem solving scenario.

% Programming Paradigms
% 
\section{Programming Paradigms}
\label{advanced:sec:paradigms}
Algorithms can be implements on many different programming paradigms.
Take the GA for example and realize it using a bunch of different paradigms.

\subsection{Procedural Programming}
The GA under a procedural paradigm

\subsection{Object-Oriented Programming}
The GA under a object oriented paradigm. Strategy pattern. modular operators, etc.

\subsection{Functional Programming}
The GA under a functional paradigm. closure etc

\subsection{Meta-Programming}
A GA under meta programming. A DSL i guess.

\subsection{Flow Programming}
A GA under a data flow or pipeline model.

\subsection{Map Reduce}
A GA under a map reduce paradigm.

\subsection{Agent Oriented Programming}
A GA under an agent oriented programming paradigm. not really suited. algorithm as an agent with goals?

% Devising New Algorithms
% 
\section{Devising New Algorithms}
\label{advanced:sec:devising}
A methodology for devising new unconventional optimization algorithms...


% 
% Testing Algorithms
% 
\section{Testing Algorithms}
\label{advanced:sec:testing}
This section will focus on the problem that `adaptive systems work even when they are not implemented correctly' (they work in-spite of the developer). Topics will include unit testing algorithms, system testing software, specific concerns when testing inspired algorithms, examples of testing algorithms with the ruby unit testing framework, examples of testing algorithms with rspec.

% 
% Visualizing Algorithms
% 
\section{Visualizing Algorithms}
\label{advanced:sec:visualizing}
This section will focus on the use of visualization as a low-fidelity form of system testing. Topics will include free visualization packages such as R, GNUPlot and Processing. Examples visualizing a decision surface, a functions response surface, and candidate solutions.

% 
% Saving Algorithm Results
% 
\section{Saving Algorithm Results}
\label{advanced:sec:saving}
This section will focus on algorithms and techniques as a fallible means to an end and the need to maintain save results. Topics will include check-pointing, storage in a database, storage on the filesystem, and algorithm restarting. Examples will be given for database, filesystem checkpointing and algorithm restarting.

% 
% Comparing Algorithms
% 
\section{Comparing Algorithms}
\label{advanced:sec:comparing}
This section will focus on comparing algorithm's based on the solutions they provide. Topics will include the use statistical hypothesis testing and free software such as R, algorithm parameter selection, distribution testing, distribution comparisons. Examples will be given for algorithm parameter selection, result distribution classification, and pair-wise result distribution comparison.

\section{Summary}
\label{advanced:sec:summary}
We learned lots of advanced topics, there are more.
