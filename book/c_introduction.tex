\label{chap:intro}

hello and welcome statement.

all about it taking a lot of work to find out what algorithms to try, and how to code them up. this book aims to take away that pain -- very important!

% What is AI
% 
\section{What is AI}
\label{intro:sec:what_is_ai}
What are all the fields and subfields we need to know about? 
taxonomy

\subsection{Artificial Intelligence}
Messy and Neat AI

\subsection{Computational Intelligence}
Fuzzy Logic, Artificial Neural Networks, and Evolutionary Computation

\subsection{Natural Computation}
Biologically Inspired Computation, Computation with Biology, Computational Biology

\subsection{Metaheuristics}
Heuristics for driving heuristics. also hyper heuristics

\subsection{Machine Learning}
Statistical methods for learning, data mining?

% 
% Algorithms

\section{Algorithms}
\label{intro:sec:algorithms}
What do we need to know about this general class of algorithms: unconventional optimization
nomenclature

\subsection{Black Box Methods}
They make little or few assumptions about the problem domain

\subsection{Randomness}
The are stochastic processes.

\subsection{State Space}
The typically require the problem to be phrased as a search space which is traversed and sampled.
We care about the size of moves, the patters of sampling and re-sampling, the number of samples managed.

\subsection{Induction}
The typically learn by doing (trial and error)
generate, guess, revise

\subsection{Problems}
What types of computational problems are we solving with these algorithms?
Give example classes for each, give canonical instances for each (all covered in this book)

\subsubsection{Function Optimization}
Generate a set of parameters (continuous) or something like a permutation (combinatorial).

\subsubsection{Function Approximation}
Generate a representation that produces outputs in the presence of inputs.

\section{Book Organization}
\label{intro:sec:organization}
How the book is structured?

\subsection{Background}
Provide you with enough information to understand the presented algorithms.

\subsection{Algorithms}
The presentation of all the algorithms, partitioned by a taxonomy. 
About the kingdoms, about the standardized algorithm description template.

\subsection{Extensions}
Things to think about once you have mastered a number of a algorithms.
