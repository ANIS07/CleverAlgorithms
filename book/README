Clever Algorithms 

This is the content and structure for the Clever Algorithms book by Jason Brownlee.

Developed using the MacTeX-2009 Distribution: http://www.tug.org/mactex/2009/
Specifically, BasicTeX: http://www.tug.org/mactex/2009/morepackages.html

JabRef is proposed for managing the bibtex: http://jabref.sourceforge.net/

To build, refer to to the Makefile.


Language rules I need to remember:
* Do not capitalize field names in text: http://www.sc.edu/webpresence/editorial_guide/capitalization.html
