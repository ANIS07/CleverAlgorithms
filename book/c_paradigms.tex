\chapter{Programming Paradigms}
\label{chap:paradigms}

\section{Overview}
It is all about programming these algorithms using different paradigms.
Take the GA for example and realize it using a bunch of different paradigms.

\section{Procedural Programming}
The GA under a procedural paradigm

\section{Object-Oriented Programming}
The GA under a object oriented paradigm. Strategy pattern. modular operators, etc.

\section{Functional Programming}
The GA under a functional paradigm. closure etc

\section{Meta-Programming}
A GA under meta programming. A DSL i guess.

\section{Flow Programming}
A GA under a data flow or pipeline model.

\section{Map Reduce}
A GA under a map reduce paradigm.

\section{Agent Oriented Programming}
A GA under an agent oriented programming paradigm. not really suited. algorithm as an agent with goals?



\section{Summary}
What did we learn in this chapter?
