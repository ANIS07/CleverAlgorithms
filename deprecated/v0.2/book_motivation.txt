* Inspire: The inspirations, strategies, and algorithms are interesting, people should be excited by them
* Simplicity: The core of the approaches is always simple although almost always poorly communicated. The book is about getting back to basics and communicating the core ideas of each approach
* Consistency: No ego, no names, no marketing of research, just the strategy and a demonstration. All approaches communicated in the same consistent manner for comparison.
* Programmer Focus: Like an engineer, lip service is great after the fact, what is important upfront is a working example. A demonstration that shows what it is all about and what it is trying to achieve - the underlying principles. Once you have that, you can then read the literature and begin to build a map of the field in your head. PRinciple first, detail later - almost always communicated the other way around.
* More: More algorithms, presented more clearly than ever has been done before. The 'art of computer programming' for computational intelligence, the touch stone for now and forever



Use Case:
1. pick an algorithm
2. do some searches on it (IEEE, google, scholar, etc) and you will get an abundance of papers, tutorials, variations, etc
3. what do you do? what is the algorithm when there 100 versions? what is it for when there are 100 different applications? 

solution: each approach as a core inspiration and a core strategy
with these two aspects in mind we can look at the procedure and an example implementation, and heuristics for using it
- we have a working copy, now if we want to push the bounds of an approach we have a platform from which to start 
- focused look at algorithms, not dumbing down, platform for expansion, comparison, etc
