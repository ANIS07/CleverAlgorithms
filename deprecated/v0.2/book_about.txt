Book - About


- there is separation between inspiration and strategy because the terminology from the inspiration can muddy the explanation of the computational/algorithmic strategy
- good practice to adopt or map onto a new nomenclature - typically does not occur
	- best practice, so it is promoted in this book
	

Inspiration : analogy or metaphor for a computational process
Strategy : abstraction of inspired metaphor with a problem, solution, and suggestion an computational system / algorithm
Procedure: specifics of realizing the strategy as a computation. how it is organized, data structures used, systemaization, parameterization
Heuristic: guidelines for using executing the strategy
Tutorial: example of realizing the approach on a problem - demonstrate strategy, realize the procedure, manifest the heuristics
