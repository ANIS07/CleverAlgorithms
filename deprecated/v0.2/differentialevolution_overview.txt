Inspiration
: Differential Evolution is inspired by the theory of evolution by means of natural selection.

Strategy
: The strategy for Differential Evolution involves perturbing existing candidate solutions based on the weighted difference between existing candidate solutions.

The Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm involves maintaining a population of candidate solutions that under go generations of recombination, evaluation, and selection. The recombination strategy is quite different to similar evolutionary algorithms involving the creation of new candidate solution components based on the weighted difference between two randomly selected population members added to a third population member (so-called classic DE). This approach perturbs population members relative relative to the spread of the broader population. In conjunction with selection, the perturbation effect self-organizes or bound the resampling of the problem space to known areas of interest.

Procedure
The Differential Evolution algorithm involves the maintenance of a population of candidate solutions that are exposed to repeated rounds of recombination, evaluation and selection referred to as generations. 

The algorithm as a specialized nomenclature for each variation of the technique describing the specifics of the configuration used in the variation. This takes the form of DE/x/y/z, where x represents the solution to be perturbed such a random or best (in the population). The y signifies the number of difference vectors used in the perturbation of x, where a difference vectors is essentially the difference between two randomly selected although distinct members of the population. Finally, z signifies the recombination operator performed such as bin for binomial and exp for exponential. 

The classical DE is noted as DE/rand/1/bin, where as variation of this approach that creates new solutions as perturbations of the best solution in the generation is noted as DE/best/1/bin.


Heuristics
* The number of parents (NP) should be 10 times the number of parameters being optimized
* Use a weighting factor (F) of 0.8
* Use a crossover rate (CR) of 0.9
* Initialize new vectors anywhere in the valid search space
* Increase to NP should decrease F and vice-versa
* Higher crossover for DE/rand/1/bin than for DE/rand/1/exp
* CR and F almost always in [0.5, 1.0]
* Common approachs: DE/rand/1/ DE/best/2/
