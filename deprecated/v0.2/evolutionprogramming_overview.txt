Inspiration
: The inspiration for evolutionary programming is the theory of evolution by means of natural selection.

Strategy
: The evolutionary programming strategy is focused on the product of the evolutionary process for problem solving.

The Evolutionary Programming (EP) algorithm is focused on evolution at the species level as a method of artificial intelligence, contrasted with heuristic-driven approaches. The strategy is concerned with the macro properties of evolution (adaptive fit in an environment) over micro concerns such as manipulating and concerning sub-symbolic information in artificial genomes.

Procedure
Traditional realizations of EP make use of a variation operator applied to each member of the population independently (no recombination operator for example) and a competitive selection process between parents and offspring for the limited number of positions in the subsequent generation. The algorithm models problems using domain specific representations.

	Evaluate
	Select breeding set
	Create offspring
	Select new population from union of old and new populations
End

More recently the field has sought to merge with the broader field of evolutionary computation, incorporating conventional genetic operators and application to a broader set of problem domains. As such, modern EP bares a strong resemblance to ES given the now standard use of self-adaptive variance operators.

Heuristics
* Heuristics to govern the mutation of self-adaptive strategy variables as well as objective variables
