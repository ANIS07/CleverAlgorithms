Inspiration
: The inspiration for the crowding genetic algorithm is the theory of evolution in the context of ecological niches.

The theory of evolution describes the diversity of species, and the new synthesis of evolutionary theory integrates a mathematical perspective of genetics with the theory. An aspect of this synthesis from population ecology is the notion of a niche, a habitat to which a species or population is adapted to suit. 

The crowding genetic algorithm is inspired by the theory of evolution, genetics as the mechanism of evolution, the genotypic-phenotypic separation for genetic operators and selection, and finally the specialization of sub-populations of a species to ecological niches in an environment.

Strategy
: The strategy of the crowding genetic algorithm is for offspring to compete with their parents based on genotypic or phenotypic similarity and phenotypic fitness, which results in the emergence of sub-populations that specialize to 

The crowding genetic algorithm belongs to a class called niching genetic algorithms. The strategy of niching the strategy is used to locate and maintain multiple good solutions to a given problem inspired by the way a population of organisms diverge into sub populations that locate and inhabit multiple ecological niches in a natural environment. The crowding strategy for niching genetic algorithms involve the use genotypic and phenotypic similarity combined with phenotypic fitness to elicit a niching effect within a population of candidate solutions. Divergence is promoted by competitive in-breeding within genotypically or phenotypically similar groups of individuals within the population.

Procedure
The crowding algorithm is conventionally realizing as an extension to the genetic algorithm. New solutions are created using a recombination operator and coping low frequency errors are introduced during the reproduction process. Competition for survival typically occurs during the replacement (integration) of offspring into the existing population of candidate solutions. This means that most or all of the population are given the opportunity to contribute genetic material to the subsequent generation, although similarity and objective fitness during replacement govern actual contributions.

Similarity measures are representation specific. A genotypic similarity measure for binary strings would be Hamming distance (number of different bits). A phenotypic similarity measure for real-valued vectors would be Euclidean distance (root of the sum of the squared differences).

Heuristics
* Niching methods are appropriate for problem domains that require the location and maintenance of multiple good solutions (a diverse set of approximate solutions to the problem). Examples of such problem domains in function optimization that have multiple optima are called multi-modal optimization problems.
* The size of the subpopulations maintained at each niche is not proprtional to the objective fitness of the niche in the problem space, but rather is proprtional to the regions basin of attraction (easiness of detecting the broader structure of the niche, like the slopes on a conical optima).
* The more niches (solutions) that are desired, the large the population needs to be set such that subpopulations can be formed and maintained around located optima.
* There are problems related to miss-leading optima, that is good solutions that are attractive, but not as good as the best optima which are harder to find (pre mature convergence - start exploiting before sufficient exploration has occurred)
* It can be difficult to identify and extract the subpopulations (multiple good solutions) from the population at the end of the run. Clustering methods can be used based on genitypic/phenotypic simiularity and objective fitness.
