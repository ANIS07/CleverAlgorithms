\chapter{Immune System Algorithms}
\label{ch:immune}

This chapter introduces algorithms inspired by the mammalian immune system. 

\section{Overview}
some context for these algorithms

\subsection{The Biological Immune System}
really about the mammalian immune system

\subsection{Artificial Immune Systems}
field focused on stealing from immunology and applying the approaches to engineering and computer science

\subsection{Further Reading}
What to do if you want to know more about this general field?

\subsubsection{Immunology}
books and papers to get into the immune side

\subsubsection{Artificial Immune Systems}
books and papers to get into the AIS side
