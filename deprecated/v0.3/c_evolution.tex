\chapter{Evolutionary Algorithms}
\label{ch:evolution}

This chapter describes algorithms inspired by \emph{the theory of evolution by means of natural selection}. Each algorithm draws from this broad inspiration in a slightly varied way. The theory of evolution accounts for the diversity of species of the planet. It describes a situation where organisms reproduce in quantities greater than can be supported by the environment, the uniqueness of individuals in the population given low frequency genetic mutations during cell division, and the competition for survival in an environment biased by individual variance. In this situation, the theory describes a process where beneficial differences between individuals accumulate in the population over time. The theory describes a natural process where organisms improve their adaptive fit for their environment.
