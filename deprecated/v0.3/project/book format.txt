Book Format

I am carefully considering the format of the book. I want each algorithm to be presented as a tutorial or recipe. Therefore the book is a cookbook of computational recipes. As recipes the implementations must be standardized, following best practices, with clear references.

Regarding the release. I believe the best approach is to push the recipes as a series of blog posts. This means a blog needs to be created for the project and a release schedule designed. 

Tutorial - set of steps to do complete a specific objective


The cookbook approach is more interesting. The problems and solutions are very specific and grouped by general commonality. 

This gives me an idea of being more modular with the approach. There is commonality for most EA's and neural nets, and even all computational intelligence algorithms. Why not exploit the modality and present it all in one book. 

- random number tools
- bitstring tools
- genetic operator tools

can combine all of these things together into algorithms/systems
don't have to crap on too much, focus on the actual code.
the modularity promotes testing and reliability
It also diversifies the content meaning more problems in getting done sooner
