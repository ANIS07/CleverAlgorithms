h1. Clever Algorithms 

h2. Overview

The Clever Algorithms project is an effort to describe a large number of algorithmic techniques from the the field of Artificial Intelligence in a complete, consistent, and centralized manner such that they are accessible, usable, and understandable. 

The Clever Algorithms project is currently hosted online at "http://www.CleverAlgorithms.com":http://www.CleverAlgorithms.com 

This is a repository for the Clever Algorithms project for hosting, versioning, and collaboration, used during the development of the content for deliverables (website and book), as well as for the ongoing maintenance of the outcomes from the project.

h3. Software

* "Algorithm Selection Script":http://github.com/jbrownlee/CleverAlgorithms/tree/master/src/algorithm_selection/ : A ruby script to apply the 'data driven optimization algorithm selection' methodology. Measures the popularity of a list of algorithms against a range of search engines, calculates a score and produces algorithm statistics and rankings. Also see the tag for the "tech report version":http://github.com/jbrownlee/CleverAlgorithms/tree/alg_selection-techreport_v20100112-1

h2. Breakdown

This project is partitioned into five efforts:

* *workspace/* A workspace for content development such as notes and technical reports that facilitates exploration and investigation independent of the book content. Content developed in the workspace may provide the basis for the book or may be directly migrated into the book. Notes are in plain text, technical reports are prepared using the LaTex type setting system and organized into sub-directories. 
* *book/* The content and structure for the publishable book. The book is prepared using the LaTex type setting system.
* *web/* A webpage used to promote the project with a specialized content management system tailored to the content of the book.
* *src/* Complete source code for the examples provided in the book. Examples are provided in the Ruby programming language.
* *deprecated/*: A collection of the work product produced during the past attempts at completing the clever algorithms project (previously called the algorithm atlas and inspired algorithms).

h2. How to Contribute

Have you found a typo in some copy? Don't agree with some statements in the content? Found a bug in the sample source code? Want to suggest an algorithm to include? Want to contribute a description of an algorithm or background content for the book?

You may want to:
* Email the author: "jasonb@CleverAlgorithms.com":mailto:jasonb@CleverAlgorithms.com
* or, Message the author though the github website: (signup and login to github, go to "http://github.com/jbrownlee":http://github.com/jbrownlee and click "Message")
* or, Fork the CleverAlgorithms project on github, make changes, and request a pull into the main project (again, you must signup and login to github and follow the github documentation for forking, contributing, and making a pull request).
